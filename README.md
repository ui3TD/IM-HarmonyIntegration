# IM-HarmonyIntegration
This [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) plugin integrates [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) into Idol Manager. You need this installed to activate any Harmony mods for Idol Manager on Steam Workshop.

The in-game mod manager has been patched to search for and load _HarmonyID_.dll in each mod's folder, where "_HarmonyID_" is a field in the mod's info.json file. Toggling mods in-game will enable/disable the Harmony patches as expected. 

Mod devs must make sure that the .dll is a C# library built on .NET 4.6 that includes Harmony compatible patches. Do not initiate the Harmony instance in your mod (i.e. do not include an Awake() method). IM-HarmonyIntegration controls all patching/unpatching operations.

See [IM-FastForward](https://github.com/ui3TD/IM-FastForward) for an example and tutorial for creating compatible mods.
